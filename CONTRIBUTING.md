CONTEXT: It's been unfunded since 2011. All effort have been in the author's own time where possible, while searching and needing employment or study opportunities, and therefore under challenging circumstances. To date, these opportunities are still needed so this project can be sustainably developed into the future. Some in university and industry have taken an interest in the ideas, but sadly some ran with ideas and made money off of them. Therefore, the project has no funding to pay for support at this time.

* Hire me if you are an agency or other organization interested in supporting this project

CONTEXT: To realize the project vision, this project is best developed in a stable team environment, such as in a PhD program, or a formal collaboration with a supporting organization (e.g. NASA).
