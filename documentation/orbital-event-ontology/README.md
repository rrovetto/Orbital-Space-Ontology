# The Orbital Event Ontology (OEO)
The OEO isan ontology describing events in the orbital space environment. As such it assumes a distnction of events from other things. OEO classes may be part of a single broader ontology, e.g., OSEO, or SSAO. This is TBD.

Conceptual Note: Events are often ontologically (philosophcially) distinguished from objects as non-event-like things. Alternative characterizations are possible. Deeper analysis requires a sustainable opportunity to pursue.
