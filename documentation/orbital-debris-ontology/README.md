# The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO)

## Description
ODO is a computational ontology describing orbital debris objects, their characteristics, the orbital debris environment, and mitigation, remediation and removal activities. 

## Scope
* ODO minimally consists of category terms for various kinds of orbital debris, their features, and interelations therein.
* The orbital debris domain, broadly construed, involves observation, detection, identificaiton, tracking and propogation (predition of future behavior or motion) of objects in space. As such this is part of the space situational awareness domain, of which orbital debris is a major concern. The central focus is the orbital space environment. 
* OD domain classes can be part of or imported into a broader ontology, e.g., an Orbital Space Ontology[3][4], Orbital Object Ontology, Space Situational Awareness Ontology [2], etc. See my other repositories. 

## Purpose and Goals
* To provide a general and common terminology and taxonomy of orbital debris about Earth (and any central body). It offers a general purpose space debris vocabulary and ontology, a reference model for the domain.
* Help facilitate data-sharing and integration among orbital debris and space object catalogues/databases
* Formally model orbital debris entities
* Encourage peaceful international cooperation among SSA communities
* Explore the philosophy and ontology of orbital debris phenomena 
* To help ensure safety of space-borne assetts (satellites, etc.), astronauts, and improve peaceful SSA and orbital environment awareness.

## Status
Under development (dependent on funding, collaboration, and circumstances to sustainably work on the project. Lack of development is due to lack of funded opportuninty to sustainably work on it.). Subject to revision. No claims to completeness are made.

## History & Contextual-Efforts
This has been a pursuit since 2011, when I conceived of this concept (verification available upon request).  Since then I've been searching for a funded opportunity (employment, PhD fellowship, research position, researcher-training network, mentors, a team, etc.) to sustainably work on, develop, and implement this ontology in a team environment with professionals in astrodynamics, astroinformatics, computer science, and ontology engineering. I have developed enough paper cocepts on this to make it a Phd project.
