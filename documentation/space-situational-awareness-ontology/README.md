# The Space Situational Awareness Ontology (SSAO)

## Description
The SSAO is an ontology of SSA, which involves observeration, detection, identification, tracking and propogation (predition of future behavior or motion) of objects in orbit; and the knowledge and beliefs generated from that. This knowledge and beliefs may be actual or confirmed, or predicted. SSAO aims to formally and computationally represent the relationships between objects near Earth (or any planetary reference frame), and annotate orbital and other SSA instance data to facilitate data-sharing and integration.

NOTE: Contact rrovetto@terpalum.umd.edu for to help develop this ontology.

## Scope
It minimally consists of class terms representing the processes and infrastructure by which persons and organizations achieve situational awareness (knowledge and beliefs) of the orbital space environment (or events and causal interactions therein). It includes at least that which affords awareness of the space environment.

These specificlly include:
- observation, detection, identification, re-identification, and tracking processes of satellites in orbit
- the physical systems and infrastructure, e.g., SSA networks (telescopes, etc.)
- the observations and measurements themselves

TBD: If expanded, the SSAO scope is the broader SSA domain. This includes class terms for the satellites themselves, other types of orbital space objects, etc. As such, an expanded version of the SSA will include terms from ODO any any satellite or spacecraft ontology. Therefore,
the overall (broader) domain--what i call the Orbital Space Environment Domain (OSEO or OSO) as expressed in more [3][4]--includes the space environment (orbital and near-Earth space) and objects therein. NOTE: as such, domain delmiting, as well as the name, scope and relation of the SSAO to other related ontologies (see [5]) by the author is subject to revision pending further research.
Given the domain, synonymous names include: 'space domain ontology' (SDO), and 'space object object' (SOO). As I've conceived it, thus far, SDO is most general, followed by SSAO, and then SOO. Further development required on these considerations.
