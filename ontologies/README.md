# Under construction
This folder will tentatively contain the ontologies under development.
This project has been pursued without support, in the authors spare time, since inception 2011. It still need financial support or employment/study opportunity to continue development. Therefore, ontologies are available as pay-per-download, and ontology development services are available by formal work arrangement. 

Please contact rrovetto[@]terpalum.umd.edu if you are interested in sponsoring, formally collaborating, or purchasing use of an ontology.
Donations are welcome and needed: https://gogetfunding.com/creating-meaning-full-space-terminologies-knowledge-models-for-space-safety/

See the 'documentation' folder for a description of the each ontology, and related material.

_Implementation Language_: currently, OWL is use, but it is anticipated/desired that KIF, CLIF, and other more expressive knowledge represenation languages will be use.
