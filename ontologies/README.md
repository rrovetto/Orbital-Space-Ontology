# Under construction
This folder contains the ontologies under development.
This project has been pursued without support, in the authors spare time, since inception 2011, and continues to need financial support or employment/study opportunity to continue development. Therefore, ontologies are available as pay-per-download, and ontology development services are available by formal work arrangement. 

Please contact rrovetto[@]terpalum.umd.edu if you are interested in sponsoring, formally collaborating, or purchasing use of an ontology.
Donations are welcome and needed: https://gogetfunding.com/creating-meaning-full-space-terminologies-knowledge-models-for-space-safety/

Existing users include an application for planetary visualization.

Implementation Language:
Currently, OWL is use, but it is anticipated that KIF, CLIF, and other knowledge represenation languages will be use.

See the 'documentation' folder for a description of the each ontology, and related material.
